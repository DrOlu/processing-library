# RunwayML library for Processing

A library to easily use [RunwayML](https://runwayml.com) with [Processing](https://processing.org/).

## Prerequisites

* [RunwayML](https://runwayml.com/): Download the latest release of [RunwayML](https://runwayml.com/download) and sign up for an account. Visit our [installation guide](https://learn.runwayml.com/#/getting-started/installation) for more details. If you encounter any issues installing RunwayML, feel free to contact us through the [support page](https://support.runwayml.com).

* [Processing](https://processing.org/): Processing version 3.0 or greater is required.

## Installation

1. Download **[RunwayML.zip](https://github.com/runwayml/processing-library/releases/download/latest/RunwayML.zip)**
2. Unzip into **Documents > Processing > libraries**
3. Restart Processing (if it was already running)

## Testing installation

Before using the library please make sure RunwayML is started and is running one model.

You can test by opening your browser and navigating to [http://localhost:8000/info](http://localhost:8000/info)
to view info about your model.

If you see a JSON string with inputs and outputs information use the Basic Example bellow !

Feel free test the Basic Example bellow.

## Basic Example

For this example run the im2txt model.

This example will print information from RunwayML (e.g. running im2txt)


```processing
// import Runway library
import com.runwayml.*;
// reference to runway instance
RunwayHTTP runway;

void setup() {
  // setup Runway HTTP connection using default host (localhost) and port (8000)
  runway = new RunwayHTTP(this);
}

void draw() {
  
}

// this is called when new Runway data is available
void runwayDataEvent(JSONObject runwayData){
  println(runwayData);
}
// this is called each time Processing connects to Runway
// Runway sends information about the current model
public void runwayInfoEvent(JSONObject info){
  println(info);
}
// if anything goes wrong
public void runwayErrorEvent(String message){
  println(message);
}
```

Notice the text running displayed in console. 

What if we want to display an image from RunwayML ?

Let's stop im2txt and use CygleGAN.
Notice on info event details about the model: the output in particular is an image with the key "image".
(You can see the information within RunwayML on the top right Network area of the Model).

Images to/from RunwayML are Base64 encoded and the library's `ModelUtils` helps convert between this format and the familiar `PImage` format.

With the CycleGAN model running we can tweak the above example to display an image received from RunwayML:

```processing
// import Runway library
import com.runwayml.*;
// reference to runway instance
RunwayHTTP runway;
// reference to image received
PImage resultImage;
void setup() {
  // setup Runway HTTP connection using default host (localhost) and port (8000)
  runway = new RunwayHTTP(this);
}
void draw() {
	// if there's an image received:
	if(resultImage != null){
		// display the image
		image(resultImage,0,0);
	}  
}
// this is called when new Runway data is available
void runwayDataEvent(JSONObject runwayData){
  // try to access "image" key and convert the received that to a PImage
  try{
  	String base64Image = runwayData.getString("image");
  	resultImage = ModelUtils.fromBase64(base64Image);
  }catch(Exception e){
  	// print an error message if the above fails
  	println("error parsing received data: " + runwayData);
  	e.printStackTrace();
  }
}
// this is called each time Processing connects to Runway
// Runway sends information about the current model
public void runwayInfoEvent(JSONObject info){
  println(info);
}
// if anything goes wrong
public void runwayErrorEvent(String message){
  println(message);
}
```
