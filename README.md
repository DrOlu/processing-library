# RunwayML library for Processing

A library to easily use [RunwayML](https://runwayml.com) with [Processing](https://processing.org/).

## How install 

### Option 1: via Contribution Manager

In Processing:

1. go to **Sketch > Import Library... > Add Library... > Contribution Manager Filter > Runway**
2. select RunwayML
3. press install

### Option 2: manually

1. Download **RunwayML.zip** from the [releases page](https://github.com/runwayml/processing-library/releases)
2. Unzip into **Documents > Processing > libraries**
3. Restart Processing (if it was already running)

## Basic Examples

This example will print `/data` from Runway (e.g. running im2txt)

```processing
// import Runway library
import com.runwayml.*;
// reference to runway instance
RunwayHTTP runway;

void setup() {
  // setup Runway
  runway = new RunwayHTTP(this);
}

void draw() {
  
}

// this is called when new Runway data is available
void runwayDataEvent(JSONObject runwayData){
  println(runwayData);
}
```
